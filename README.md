## CSS Only Animation Effect + 360 Degree Amazon Box View On Mousemove

This is one of my favorite CSS tutorial I checked and coded from the Online Tutorials [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UJ7J1lM2Bw)

Believe it or not, this is mostly HTML and CSS and a couple of JS vanilla lines!!

I practiced here 3D perspective a lot of creative ways to draw objects with rotate transformation and a nice trick using two lines of JS.  Everything arranged in an elegant coding style.

I hope you like it, code it and [watch it](https://gustavolando.github.io/otCSSOnlyAnimationEffect360DegreeAmazonCardBoxViewOnMousemove/) !
